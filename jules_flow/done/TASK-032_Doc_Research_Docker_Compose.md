### Descrição

Research official documentation for Docker and Docker Compose, focusing on best practices for containerizing a Python/FastAPI application and orchestrating it with other services (like PostgreSQL/Redis) as planned for the 'transcritor-pdf' project and its integration with `modular-dashboard-adv`. Create a summary reference file named `docs/reference/docker_compose_summary.txt`.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [x] Official Docker and Docker Compose documentation websites identified and accessed.
- [x] Key information relevant to the project (writing Dockerfiles for Python apps, multi-stage builds, optimizing image size, Docker Compose syntax for defining services, volumes, networks, environment variables, and managing dependencies between services) reviewed.
- [x] Understand how the `transcritor-pdf` service will fit into the `modular-dashboard-adv`'s `docker-compose.yml`. (Conceptualized, with detailed integration to be handled in a subsequent task, informed by user feedback about the target repository).
- [x] Summary reference file `docs/reference/docker_compose_summary.txt` created with key findings, best practices, links, and example snippets for Dockerfile and Docker Compose configurations.

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `ROADMAP.md` (Phase 8)
* `Dockerfile`
* `.dockerignore`
* `docker-compose.yml` (from `modular-dashboard-adv` once integrated)
* `docs/reference/docker_compose_summary.txt`

### Relatório de Execução

**2025-06-15:**
- Identified key official documentation URLs for Docker and Docker Compose.
- Reviewed documentation on:
    - Dockerfile best practices for Python/FastAPI applications (slim base images, multi-stage builds, non-root users, dependency caching, Uvicorn CMD).
    - Python-specific containerization guides.
    - Docker Compose file structure (services, build, image, ports, volumes, environment, depends_on, healthchecks, networks).
    - Docker Compose Quickstart and file reference.
- Conceptualized a standalone `docker-compose.yml` for `transcritor-pdf` (including API and DB services) and noted considerations for its integration into `modular-dashboard-adv`.
- Created the summary document `docs/reference/docker_compose_summary.txt` detailing all findings, best practices, and example configurations.
