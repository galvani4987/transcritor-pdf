### Descrição

Jules-Flow task `TASK-022_F9_Escrever_Testes_Fila_Assincrona.md` is in `jules_flow/backlog/` and `TASK_INDEX.md` lists its status as `backlog`. However, its internal frontmatter and `ROADMAP.md` indicate it's done.

### Critérios de Aceitação

- [X] Status of `TASK-022` in `jules_flow/TASK_INDEX.md` is updated from `backlog` to `done`.
- [X] File `jules_flow/backlog/TASK-022_F9_Escrever_Testes_Fila_Assincrona.md` is moved to `jules_flow/done/`.

### Arquivos Relevantes

* `jules_flow/TASK_INDEX.md`
* `jules_flow/backlog/TASK-022_F9_Escrever_Testes_Fila_Assincrona.md`
* `jules_flow/done/`

### Relatório de Execução

TASK-022 was verified and found to be already consistent:
- Its status in `jules_flow/done/TASK-022_F9_Escrever_Testes_Fila_Assincrona.md` is `done`.
- It is located in the `jules_flow/done/` directory.
- `jules_flow/TASK_INDEX.md` correctly lists TASK-022 as `done` and links to the `done` directory.

Therefore, the original actions planned for TASK-040 were not necessary. TASK-040's status has been updated to `done`, and this file will be moved to the `jules_flow/done/` directory. The `TASK_INDEX.md` already reflects TASK-040 as `done` and points to the correct location.
